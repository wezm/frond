ðŸŒ´ Frond Markdown Notes
======================

Frond is a lightweight, web based, self-hosted app for storing Markdown notes.

I created Frond ~~because everyone must build a notes app at least once~~ as replacement for Simplenote after I experienced bugs and flaky behaviour. I switched to Fastmail notes, which work pretty well but they don't have any Markdown features such as Markdown aware editing, or preview. I also tried Standard Notes but the Markdown support overrides the `textarea` meaning all native functionality like spell checking is lost when editing on mobile.
